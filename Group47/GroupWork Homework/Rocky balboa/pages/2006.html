        <h1>Rocky Balboa (2006)</h1>
        <h2><b>The Last Stand</b></h2>
        <p>Years after retiring, Rocky struggles with the loss of Adrian and finds himself feeling disconnected from
            life. When a computer simulation suggests he could beat the current champion, he decides to step back into
            the ring for one last fight, proving that age is just a number and passion never dies.
