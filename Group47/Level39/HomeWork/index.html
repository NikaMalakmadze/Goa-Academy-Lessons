                <p>Animals are a diverse group of living organisms that play important roles in ecosystems worldwide. They range from microscopic creatures to large mammals and exhibit a variety of behaviors and adaptations. Most animals are multicellular, and many have specialized systems for movement, feeding, and reproduction. Some species are domesticated and live alongside humans, while others are wild and thrive in their natural habitats.</p>
