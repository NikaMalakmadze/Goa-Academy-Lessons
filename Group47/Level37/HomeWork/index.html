                <p>Sea horses are small, delicate marine creatures known for their horse-like heads and upright swimming
                    posture. These fascinating creatures are found in shallow waters, often clinging to seagrass or
                    corals. Male sea horses are unique in that they carry and give birth to the offspring, making them
                    one of the few species where males play a key role in reproduction.</p>
