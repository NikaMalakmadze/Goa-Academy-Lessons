        <h1>Ocean currents</h1>
        <h2><b>The Blue Planet</b></h2>
        <p> Ocean currents are large-scale movements of seawater driven by wind, temperature differences, and the
            Earth's rotation. They play a crucial role in regulating climate, distributing nutrients, and influencing
            weather patterns. Understanding currents is vital for navigation, climate science, and marine ecology.</p>
