        <h1>Deep sea</h1>
        <h2><b>The Blue Planet</b></h2>
        <p>The deep sea refers to ocean waters below 200 meters, characterized by high pressure, low temperatures, and
            darkness. This mysterious environment is home to unique organisms, many of which have adapted to extreme
            conditions. Deep-sea exploration reveals new species and helps us understand ocean health.</p>
