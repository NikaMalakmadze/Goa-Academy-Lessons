            <p>Computers are powerful electronic devices used for a wide range of tasks, from personal computing to
                complex business operations. They process data, execute software instructions, and allow users to
                interact with information in innovative ways.</p>
            <p>Modern computers come in many forms, from desktops to laptops, tablets, and even smart devices. They
                are
                essential tools for communication, entertainment, research, and productivity. With advances in
                artificial intelligence and machine learning, computers are now capable of performing tasks that
                once
                required human intelligence.</p>
