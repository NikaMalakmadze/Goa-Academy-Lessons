                <p>Frogs are amphibians found all over the world, except in Antarctica. They have powerful hind legs
                    that help them jump long distances, and they are known for their croaking sounds. Frogs play vital
                    roles in ecosystems, acting as both predators and prey. They are an important part of the food chain
                    and are also used in scientific research for studying developmental biology.</p>
