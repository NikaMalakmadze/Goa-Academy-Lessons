        <h2><b>The Blue Planet</b></h2>
        <p>Coral reefs are vibrant underwater ecosystems formed by colonies of tiny animals called corals. They provide
            habitat for countless marine species, protect coastlines from erosion, and are vital for biodiversity.
            However, they face threats from climate change, pollution, and overfishing.</p>
