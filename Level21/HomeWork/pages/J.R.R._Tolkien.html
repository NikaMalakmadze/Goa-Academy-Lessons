                <p>Welcome to the magical world of J.R.R. Tolkien, the creator of Middle-Earth, the rich fantasy
                    universe that gave birth to The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion. Tolkien’s works
                    have shaped modern fantasy and continue to captivate readers around the world.

                    <p>Did you know? J.R.R. Tolkien was a philologist, meaning he studied languages. He even created
                        entire languages for his books, including Quenya and Sindarin, the languages of the Elves.

                <p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born in 1892 in Bloemfontein, South Africa, and grew up in England. A
                    scholar, soldier, and father, Tolkien’s life was rich with experiences that influenced his writing.
                    He became a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University, where his love of ancient myth, language,
                    and storytelling flourished.</p>

                <h3>The Middle-Earth Universe</h3>
                <p>Tolkien’s greatest legacy is Middle-Earth, the fictional world he painstakingly created. From the
                    Shire to Mordor, Middle-Earth is a richly detailed world of diverse cultures, languages, creatures,
                    and histories. It is the setting for many of his works, most famously The Hobbit and The Lord of the
                    Rings.

                <h2 id="Themes_&_Influence">Themes & Influence</h2>
                <p>Tolkien’s works are known for their deep themes, complex characters, and rich symbolism. The Lord of
                    the Rings explores themes of friendship, sacrifice, and the corrupting influence of power. Tolkien’s
                    love of nature, his experiences in war, and his knowledge of mythology and languages all influenced
                    his writing.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="aside-text-box"><span class="bold">The Hero's Journey: "The journey of Frodo Baggins in
                            The Lord of the Rings as a modern interpretation of the hero archetype."</span></li>
