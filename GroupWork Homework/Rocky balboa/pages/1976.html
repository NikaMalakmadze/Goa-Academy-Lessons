        <h1>Rocky (1976)</h1>
        <h2><b>The Rise of an Underdog</b></h2>
        <p>The original film introduces us to Rocky Balboa, a small-time boxer and debt collector in Philadelphia. When
            heavyweight champion Apollo Creed offers him a shot at the title, Rocky trains tirelessly to prove he can go
            the distance, not just for himself but for everyone who believes in him.
